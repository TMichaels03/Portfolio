Project: Cell Life Simulation

Language: Java

Premise:
This program utilizes the rules of Conway's Game of Life. This is represented by a set of rules.

 - Any live cell (represented by 1) with two or three live neighbors survives.
 - Any dead cell (represented by 0) with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
 - All other live cells die in the next generation / iteration.
 
The program creates a two dimensional array to simulate 100 iterations.

There is also a version that includes two differing cell life (live cells represented by 1 or 2).
