Program: File Finder

Language: Python

Premise:
Finder.py searches recursively through files and copies them. After copying, it creates a log file with the orginal directory of the files copied as well as their size in bytes. This program will not copy any file over the size of 1/2 GB (54288000 Bytes) individually. Collectively, however, files may exceed this limit.

Arguments:
[1] = topdir : Directory to start search in. Will never go above this directory.
[2] = extensions : List of extensions to search for. Format: [a,b,c,d] or [a, b, c, d]
 >> Using .* as extension search - [.*] - will cause all files to be copied.
[3] = copydir : Directory that files will be copied to.

Example:
python "Finder.py" "C:/Users/User/Desktop" [.txt] "C:/Users/User/Desktop/Copy"

This will search the users Desktop and all aub-directories for any .txt file. Any file below 1/2 GB will be copied afterward to a folder named "Copy". If the folder does not exist, it will create one.
